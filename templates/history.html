        <h2>The Story of Lower Merion</h2>
        <p>Lower Merion's story begins long before streets, railroads, or neighborhoods. It begins with a landscape shaped by rivers and forests, inhabited by people who understood its rhythm. Over centuries, new communities arrived, industries rose and fell, and a township full of identity and character emerged. This is the journey of the place we call home.</p>

        <h3>The Lenni-Lenape Homeland</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='lenapefarmers.jpeg') }}" alt="Lenape Farmers" class="timeline-image-full">
        <p>Before any European settlers stepped onto this land, Lower Merion was part of the homeland of the Lenni-Lenape people. They lived along the Schuylkill River, following its cycles for food, transportation, and trade. Villages and hunting paths lined the region, many of which later shaped the roads and properties of the township. Their stewardship of the land established the earliest chapter of Lower Merion's identity—one grounded in respect for nature and community.</p>

        <h3>The Welsh Tract and Early Settlement</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='pennsilvaniamapwithlenapehouses.jpg') }}" alt="Pennsylvania Map" class="timeline-image-full">
        <p>In 1682, Welsh Quakers arrived seeking a place where they could build a self-governed community. William Penn granted them a vast region called the Welsh Tract. What would become Lower Merion grew from these settlers' farms, mills, and the traditions they carried across the Atlantic. Their most enduring landmark, the Merion Friends Meeting House, still stands today as one of the oldest continuous houses of worship in the United States.</p>

        <h3>Colonial Growth and Mills</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='youngsfordrighters.jpg') }}" alt="Historic Mill" class="timeline-image-full">
        <p>Throughout the 1700s, the township transformed into a network of early industry powered by creeks and streams. Gristmills, sawmills, and blacksmith shops formed the base of a developing economy. Roads like Old Lancaster Road connected farms to Philadelphia markets. By the Revolutionary War, Lower Merion had become a strategically important stopover for travelers moving between major colonial centers.</p>

        <h3>The Railroad and the Birth of the Main Line</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='golden-mile-1977.jpg') }}" alt="Railroad Era" class="timeline-image-full">
        <p>The 19th century marked the era that reshaped Lower Merion forever. When the Pennsylvania Railroad built a new line running west out of Philadelphia, it passed directly through the township. Elegant stations and planned communities emerged, attracting city residents looking for clean air, open space, and a quieter life. This corridor became famously known as the Main Line, one of the most recognized suburban regions in the nation.</p>

    <div class="summary-section">
        <h3>20th-Century Suburban Identity</h3>
        <p>The early 1900s brought new neighborhoods, schools, and cultural institutions. Lower Merion High School opened its doors, becoming a central part of township life. Suburban Square in Ardmore grew into one of the first modern shopping centers in the country. Parks, libraries, and civic buildings filled the map as the township evolved into a vibrant suburban hub while still maintaining its historic roots.</p>

        <h3>Lower Merion Today</h3>
        <p>Modern Lower Merion is a mosaic of historic landmarks, diverse neighborhoods, and active community life. From the green trails of Cynwyd Heritage Trail to the energy of Ardmore Music Hall, the township blends its past and present seamlessly. Its schools, small businesses, and cultural destinations continue to define it as a place where history is not just remembered—it is lived every day.</p>
