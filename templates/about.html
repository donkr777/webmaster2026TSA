    <p>
        This website was created for the Technology Student Association (TSA) 
        Webmaster competition. The purpose of this site is to educate users 
        about the Lenape Native American tribe and their historical presence 
        in Pennsylvania, while aligning with the national TSA theme.

        The goal of this project is to preserve and share historical knowledge 
        using modern web technologies. By combining history with technology, 
        this website demonstrates how digital tools can be used to keep cultural 
        stories and traditions accessible for future generations.

    <h2>Design and Development</h2>

        competition guidelines.
